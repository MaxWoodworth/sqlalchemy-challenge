# sqlalchemy-challenge

## Some links I used to help with sytling matplot lib and remembering how to unravel a list.

I struggled intially as for whatever reason my jupyter notebook wanted to tell me that I did not have pandas installed on my virtual environment. I ended up making a new virtual environment which meant having to pip install matplotlib, numpy, sqlalchemy, and flask. That was a bit of a pain but from there it was mostly smooth sailing. 

Having come back to this after the completion of project 2 I am intimately familiar with flask routes and those were a relatively non issue. Once I was working on the app.py it was mostly copying what I had already dont on the jupyter notebook anyway. 

Remembering how to setup plots with matplot lib did require a little brushup however. 

Overall I am happy with the result and will have to come back to the bonus section and update in the future.
